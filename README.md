My Hotel is located in Puerto Vallarta.  The weather widget at the top of the home page shows the current weather in My Hotel's location.  Below, is an image of My Hotel, and some information about my business.  Use the top navigation bar to get to the reservations page and fill out the form with your personal information and the dates you would like to stay. You only have 15 minutes to complete the form as indicated by a countdown timer at the top of the page. A mix of HTML and JS validation come into play here.  Go to the Contact Us page to submit a comment and display the current comments on the page by clicking the "Read Reviews" button below, or for more information hit the "Expedia" link to look at more details and other hotels in the area.  

Some extra features for user interactivity include color-changing title's on every page via 'mouseover/mouseout' events, connecting to a weather forecast API, and the comment section on the Contact Us page.
